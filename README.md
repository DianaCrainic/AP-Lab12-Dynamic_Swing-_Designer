## Dynamic Swing Designer

- Compulsory (all tasks done):
  - Create the class MainFrame of type JFrame, that will also represent the main class of the application. The frame will contain a ControlPanel in the north and a DesignPanel in the center.
  - The ControlPanel will allow the user to specify any class name of a Swing component (such as javax.swing.JButton, javax.swing.JLabel, etc.), a default text for that component (if applicable) and a button for creating and adding an instance of the specified component to the DesignPanel.
  - The DesignPanel represents a simple JPanel, using absolute positioning of its components and containing Swing components added by our application.
